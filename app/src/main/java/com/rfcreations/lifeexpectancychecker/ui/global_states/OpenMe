 * This package(global_states) stores global state values to be provided via dagger hilt
 * Global states are state values that leads to recomposition
 * but will be too cumbersome to be passed unto composable functions down the hierarchy
 * Example: Theme
 * passing theme down to settings screen will be too cumbersome therefore it is made a class that is
 * injected into the settings screen viewmodel
